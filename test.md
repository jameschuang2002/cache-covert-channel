### 1. **Do you have ulterior motives? (Politics, Power, Causing Trouble)**

This election is not a political statement. It is a response to the lack of transparency and accountability in the club’s leadership. As a graduate student focused on pursuing a PhD, the presidency offers me little personal gain—only responsibility.

We’ve continued this fight because we believe fairness and transparency matter. One of our main goals is simply to know how much money was collected, how much was spent, and where the funds are now. No one would go through the effort of contacting multiple offices, organizing petitions, and navigating institutional bureaucracy just to cause trouble or gain a title.

### 2. **What motivated this movement?**

This began last year with requests for financial transparency, which were repeatedly denied. We escalated the issue step by step—through petitions, formal complaints, conversations with Student Organizations and Sport Programs, and ultimately, a case submitted to the Student Conduct Office.

When all channels failed, we realized the only way forward was to organize a leadership transition ourselves.

---

### 3. **Did you try to communicate or negotiate with the current officers?**

Yes. Initially, we reached out privately, hoping there was a simple misunderstanding. Instead, we were met with defensiveness and were told our concerns were “baseless.” Officers even stated they would welcome a “formal intervention.”

Once we began formal proceedings, it became clear that private negotiations—without third-party mediation—would be inappropriate, especially during an open conduct investigation. We have since limited private contact to maintain integrity and respect the process.

### 4. **Are the petition signers and complaint endorsers biased?**

The petition was open to any interested member and was shared at practices. People supported it of their own volition. Naturally, those who signed are more likely to support our position—but that does not invalidate the concerns raised.

Our complaint was based on public information, first-hand experiences, and historical accounts. We aimed for objectivity but acknowledged our limitations and urged the Student Conduct Office to carry out an impartial investigation to uncover the full truth.

---

### 5. **Why are you hosting the election instead of the officers or Sport Programs?**

We repeatedly asked Student Organizations and Sport Programs to intervene due to a clear conflict of interest. They declined, stating that they do not get involved in internal club elections.

Despite earlier promises that an election would be held by the end of the semester, no action was taken. After extensive internal debate—and despite initial hesitation—we concluded that calling our own meeting was the only path left.

---

### 6. **Is this election constitutional, even without officer endorsement?**

Yes. According to Articles VIII and IX of the Constitution:

- _“Members can voluntarily serve as the club committee and attend meetings.”_
    
- _“Elections are held during committee meetings.”_
    

The Constitution does not require officers to host these meetings, nor does it define the format, location, or timeline. There are no restrictions that prevent members from organizing committee meetings and holding elections.

The current officers did not endorse this election, but such endorsement is not constitutionally required. We moved forward in the absence of leadership and in good faith with the club’s best interest in mind.

---

### 7. **Are the organizers even members of the club?**

Yes. Since membership fees were refunded this year, our understanding is that members are defined as those who:

1. Registered on **Heels Life**, and
    
2. Registered in the **DSE roster**, per the steps on the Badminton Club’s Heels Life page.
    

We have fulfilled both requirements and therefore believe we are eligible participants and organizers.

### 8. **Was the election fair, with limited notice and only one candidate? Will there be a debate?**

We do not have access to the official club mailing list. We’ve shared election details as widely as possible—via practice sessions, personal outreach, and word-of-mouth. We’ve accepted nominations through 5 pm on April 16th and included a write-in option on the ballot. Voting was extended from 5 pm – 7 pm to allow broader participation.

Unfortunately, only one candidate was nominated, despite our repeated calls. We were unable to organize a formal debate, but we welcome any member to share their vision, concerns, or proposals.

We recognize this is not an ideal process. However, in the absence of leadership and access to full club resources, we’ve done everything in our power to ensure openness, flexibility, and participation. Our goal is to lay the groundwork for a better future election process.

---

### 9. **Will the school certify the results?**

Before the election, we sent formal notices to:

- **Student Organizations** (Tammy Lambert)
    
- **Sport Programs** (Jeremy McKendall)
    
- **Faculty Advisor** (Polin Lini Ge)
    

After the election, we will submit supporting documents, including footage, to these offices for review. Certification will ultimately be at their discretion. We will continue advocating for meaningful recognition and transition.

---

### 10. **Is this creating division in the club?**

Our goal has always been to make the club better—to one day compete nationally and thrive as a transparent, inclusive community.

Despite our efforts to remain impartial and principled, some people (even those who agree with our concerns) have criticized our methods. We’ve adjusted where we could but remain committed to fairness, integrity, and reform.

---

### 11. **Has your movement caused the club’s demotion from a Sport Club to a Student Organization?**

We recognize our actions may have accelerated this process, but they did not cause it. In our conversations with Sport Programs, they expressed concern that the club was already failing to meet Sport Club expectations.

We believe that the current mismanagement and institutional neglect is the real issue. In our meetings with officials, we’ve emphasized that UNC has a large and passionate badminton community that deserves representation.

If the university ultimately dismantles the current club, we are fully committed to starting a new one that meets all guidelines and better serves the community.
